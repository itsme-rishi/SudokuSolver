# SudokuSolver
c++ code for solving sudoku
input the sudoku with given numbers and 0 in place of empty spaces and you are good to go.
I assigned sets with numbers 1,2,..,9 for all empty boxes. then removed the number from set if it is present in row or coloumn or box and filled the emtpy box with a number when the set size becomes 1. then continued this process untill sudoku is filled completely.
